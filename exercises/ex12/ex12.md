# Exercise 12
## Threads

Reading: Chapter 12 of *Head First C*.

1) In this directory you should find `counter.c`, a program that runs
multiple threads and checks for synchronization errors.

It uses an array to simulate a shared work queue.  The idea is that
each element of the array represents a unit of work.  We want to run
multiple threads to do the work, but we have to make sure each unit
of work gets done exactly once.

So we use a counter to keep track of the next unallocated unit of
work.  Each thread should check the counter to see which unit to
work on, do the work, and then increment one element of the array
to indicate that the unit is done.

If everything works correctly, each element of the array should be
incremented exactly once.  If there are synchronization errors, some
elements might be 0, or greater than 1.

Read through `counter.c` to make sure you understand the code.

2) One of the functions in `counter.c` is `make_thread`, which
creates a new child thread.  One of its parameters, `entry`, is
a pointer to a function, so the syntax is a little complicated:

    pthread_t make_thread(void *(*entry)(void *), Shared *shared)
    {
        int ret;
        pthread_t thread;

        ret = pthread_create (&thread, NULL, entry, (void *) shared);
        if (ret != 0) perror_exit ("pthread_create failed");
        return thread;
    }

If you are not sure about this type declaration, you can use
[cdecl.org](http://cdecl.org) to interpret it.


3) Use the Makefile to compile `counter.c` and run it.  Since the
access to the counter and the shared array is unsynchronized, you
will probably see some errors.

4) Make a copy of `counter.c` called `counter_mutex.c` and
add synchronization code to eliminate the race errors.  

You'll need to add a `Semaphore` to the `Shared` object and then use it 
in `child_code`.  Confirm that your new version has no sync errors.

5) Synchronization takes some time.  Comment out the print statements
in `counter.c` and `counter_mutex.c`, then recompile and time them.

    time ./counter
    time ./counter_mutex

How much overhead does the synchronization impose?
