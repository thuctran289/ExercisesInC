###Written Reflection

On a high level, I feel like this sprint was a lot slower for me in terms of activity. I had spent a large portion of this sprint thinking about what the framework for actually merging the client and server behaviours into one overall client, but that was mostly on a non-coding high level of concept. In terms of learning goals, this probably helped me to figure out how to develop more complex code a bit, but I had definitely ran into issues with components being hard to break up into more portable pieces for individuals to work on. This was especially a problem because there were definitely times in which the distribution of tasks had left some people with fewer tasks than they would have liked, which is definitely problematic. 

Although I still have grown a lot in terms of my confidence for the sprint (esp. with respect to being able to help other people on my team with respect to bug fixing and integration), I still have concens over how to really distribute and create code that can be worked on by multiple people. In particular, when we were redistributing tasks with respect to the network behavior, people had found that my code was relatively unreadable, and there were challenges with figuring out how to distribute tasks regarding that codebase. I think part of this is that we really didn't move forward on doing pair programming as much as we could due to the task distribution. As a result, when we were pair programming while integrating, we had some issues due to needing to figure out how to cleanly mesh components together for integration. I think a more formal/specific interface control document/API standard would have minimized integration, and maybe should have been something pushed more in the beginning of the project. At the same time, I can't help but feel like Olin doesn't tend to do that kind of thing for in-class projects due to the time investment needed. 

In terms of the process, I felt like we weren't adhering to the scrum structure as well as we could have been. In particular, I felt like I wasn't utilizing Trello for figuring out which specific task to work on well. Additionally, I don't believe that my group had really adhered to the ceremonies of scrum (i.e. as regular meetings as we had originally planned). 

In terms of activity, for my part, I think it hadn't progressed as far as I would be comfortable with (i.e. the networking protocol as one program and its state machine equivalanet) However, the other parts (i.e. piece selection, tracker, torrent parsing) seem to be done now, which I'm really happy for. I will imagine that this last weekend will lead to a pretty hectic time crunch in finalizing the structure.
