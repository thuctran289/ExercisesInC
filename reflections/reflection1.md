###Written Reflection

In terms of my learning goals, I think that I am much more comfortable with C 
now than I was at the beginning of the class. Although I had some exposure 
and experience with C prior to the class, I still felt that I was very 
shaky on many parts. The work to try to create a bittorrent compliant client 
and server had definitely solidified my understanding of the various elements.

Lookings back, I think that we were able to define much more concrete tasks 
and roles for people during the sprint. We were able to populate a backlog 
with a decent amount of tasks, but if I am recalling correctly, still lacking
coding parts. However, I still don't really think we thought far enough ahead
given the state that we were at. Given that, when I tried to start writing 
code for a part I was interested in (the networking part) outside of meetings,
I ended up writing some code without talking about how it fits in the grand 
scheme of the program. Although there weren't too many issues associated with
this during the past half of the sprint or so, I think that looking forward
there are a few concerns now in trying to show how it works to the other 
members of my team. 

Fortunately, during our scrum meetings, we were able to meet up later to kind
of discuss specific tasks that could be delegated still, but I still feel bad
about how that worked out. As a result, I ended up as the network person for 
the client side of the program which I am happy about, but I'm worried that
the other people in my group who want to learn it won't get as much 
opportunity to pick it up. I think that moving forward we are going to try to
stay more synchronized w.r.t. things by doing more pair-programming meetings
and trying to document code better. 

In terms of how our work prepared us for the sprint review, I think that the 
initial start for the code was good, but we were definitely unprepared for the
general topics questions. We will likely be doing more specific prep prior to 
our next review. 

In terms of our activity, I actually think that we are likely to get much 
further than what I initially anticipated. I honestly thought that, prior to 
the project, that we would have been able only get simple p2p 
communication by the end of sprint 2, but we look like we will be able to 
accomplish a few of our stretch goals (fingers crossed)





###Solutions for HFC 2,3, 10, 11
Note that I had generally written in-line w/ the exercise description file and the actual code. Also note that 
I had written up chapter 10 instead of chapter 1, due to doing chapter 1 at a different time prior to knowing 
the format of how to turn it in. I will likely be doing that for a following sprint. (I had written comments at the 
top of each assembly instruction out. )

### Solutions for TOS:
Due to our group's relative inexperience w/ C, we decided to focus on HFC instead, hence the four chapters listed above.
